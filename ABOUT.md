About Hotel Deals Project
I tried to demonstrate the ability to develop a web project using Spring MVC framework with the use of maven and JAVA, keeping in mind 
not to complicate the task and keeping it simple.
This project consumes a Rest web service that returns list of hotel deals and display it in a web page,
I've used Apache HttpClient to consume the Rest API, Google GSON library to map Json to Java Classes (POJOs) and 
for the View I've used JSTL with the use of bootstrap and HTML5.
I'm at Entry level in developing web projects using Spring, basic knowledge in JSTL, very good knowledge in Java.
